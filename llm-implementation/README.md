# LLM Implementation System

This folder contains a comprehensive, compartmentalized prompt system designed to guide an LLM through creating a world-class frontend implementation for the Vitalis CLI project.

## üìÅ Contents

### **System Overview**

- `LLM_PROMPT_SYSTEM.md` - Main system architecture and overview
- `LLM_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPTS.md` - Complete implementation guide with all phases

### **Phase Files**

- `PHASE_1A_PROJECT_INITIALIZATION.md` - Next.js 15 project setup
- `PHASE_1B_DEPENDENCIES_CONFIGURATION.md` - Dependencies and configuration
- `PHASE_3A_FRAMER_MOTION_SETUP.md` - Animation system setup
- `PHASE_6A_CHAT_INTERFACE.md` - Chat interface implementation

## üéØ Purpose

This system is designed to:

- **Guide LLM Implementation** - Step-by-step instructions for creating a modern frontend
- **Ensure Quality** - Validation criteria and testing protocols at each phase
- **Maintain Consistency** - Standardized approach across all implementation phases
- **Enable Iteration** - Ability to repeat phases if quality standards aren't met

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Start with Phase 1A** and complete each phase sequentially
2. **Validate thoroughly** using provided criteria before proceeding
3. **Test extensively** to ensure world-class polish
4. **Repeat phases** if quality standards aren't met

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Each phase is **self-contained** with complete instructions
- **No shortcuts** - Implement every detail with precision
- **Quality first** - World-class polish at every step
- **Test everything** - Validate functionality at each phase

## üìã Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict typing
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with custom design system
- **Animations**: Framer Motion with physics-based animations
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui with Radix primitives
- **State Management**: Zustand with persistence
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for live features

_This implementation system ensures the creation of a production-ready, accessible, and performant frontend application through careful, methodical execution of each compartmentalized phase._
